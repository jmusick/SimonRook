		blurb:
			"A problem-focused, exercise-driven introduction to Stoic practice for people caught in cycles of indecision and rumination.",
		description: [
			"Overthinking rarely looks like a problem from the inside. It looks like responsibility. You replay the conversation because you want to get it right. You research the decision because you want to choose well. You wait one more night because acting too soon would be careless. Hours of genuine mental effort pass without producing a decision, a plan, or a single new fact.",
			"This book is about recognizing the point where thinking stops serving life and starts postponing it — and, more importantly, about knowing what to do next. The Stoics were unusually well equipped for that problem. They separated an event from our judgment about it, distinguished what depends on our choices from what remains exposed to chance and other people, and asked how a person could act well while outcomes stayed uncertain.",
			"Instead of asking how to make things turn out exactly as you want, Stoicism asks a smaller and far more useful question: what is mine to do, and how can I do it well? Across twelve chapters and a twenty-one-day practice, this is a beginner-friendly system for answering it — no prior knowledge of philosophy assumed, and no promise of a life without discomfort.",
